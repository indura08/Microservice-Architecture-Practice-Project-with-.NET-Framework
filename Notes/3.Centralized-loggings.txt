🧩 Part 1: What is Centralized Logging & Monitoring?
---------------------------------------------------------

When you have multiple microservices, logs from each one are scattered in different places. 😵

Centralized Logging means:

Collecting logs from all services into one place (a "log dashboard") so you can search, filter, and analyze them.

Monitoring means:

Watching real-time health, metrics, performance like CPU, memory, response time, and error rates.


🔍 Why Is It So Important?
----------------------------

Without centralized logging, you’ll be like:

"Which microservice failed? Where’s the error? Why is it slow?"

With centralized logging, you just: ✅ Open one dashboard
✅ Search Error 500 or UserId: 123
✅ Get answers instantly


🧰 The Two Most Popular Tools:
---------------------------------

1️⃣ ELK Stack (Elastic Stack) – Used for centralized logging

Elasticsearch – Powerful search engine

Logstash – Collects logs

Kibana – Beautiful dashboard

🔎 Purpose: LOGGING (search, filter logs, debug errors, etc.)


2️⃣ Prometheus + Grafana – Used for metrics & monitoring
--------------------------------------------------------

Prometheus – Collects time-series metrics (CPU, RAM, errors, etc.)

Grafana – Dashboard to visualize metrics

📊 Purpose: MONITORING (CPU usage, memory, requests/sec, health checks, etc.)


🚀 How to Use These with ASP.NET Microservices
------------------------------------------------

👇 I’ll give you both setups (choose one or both):

🌍 PART A: ELK Stack (for logging)
-------------------------------------

Step 1: Setup ELK (you can use Docker to make it easy)
Create a docker-compose.yml:

version: '3.7'
services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.17.9
    environment:
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - xpack.security.enabled=false
    ports:
      - "9200:9200"

  kibana:
    image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:7.17.9
    ports:
      - "5601:5601"
    environment:
      - ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS=http://elasticsearch:9200
